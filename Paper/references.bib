  abstract = {Flower color, which varies widely in potted multiflora chrysanthemum, is an extremely important character for classification. A quantitative definition of the flower color of potted multiflora chrysanthemums and the establishment of a standard color classification system may help us to evaluate the germplasm resources effectively. In this study, 273 potted multiflora chrysanthemum advanced lines were selected as materials. First, color classification results were compared between two methods: one is a combination of CIELAB and Munsell color systems, and the other one applying Q clustering analysis based on the CIELAB color system. We then divided the 273 lines into six color groups. The composition and content of anthocyanins and carotenoids in the different color advanced lines were identified by HPLC-MS. Two derivatives of cyanidin, cyanidin-3-O-(6″-O-malonyl-glucoside) and cyanidin-3-O-(3″,6″-O-dimalonyl-β-glucopyanoside), were identified in the pink, purple, orange-brown, and red lines. The carotenoids, primarily consisting of violanthin, z-violanthin, 9′z-lutein 5,6-epoxide, lutein, α-carotene, β-carotene, and 9z-β-carotene, were identified in all chrysanthemum advanced lines. Additionally, a*, represents the green-red component with green in the negative direction and red in the positive direction, was strongly positively correlated with cyanidin-3-O-(6″-O-malonyl-glucoside) (r = 0.884, P < 0.01), cyanidin-3-O-(3″, 6″-O-dimalonyl-β-glucopyanoside) (r = 0.864, P < 0.01) and total anthocyanins (r = 0.896, P < 0.01) by linear regression analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients. Meanwhile, b*, represents the blue–yellow component with blue in the negative direction and yellow in the positive direction, was strongly positively correlated with lutein (r = 0.804, P < 0.01) and total carotenoids (r = 0.881, P＜0.01) in potted multiflora chrysanthemum. Then, linear equations were obtained according to the significant correlations between a* and anthocyanins and b* and carotenoids. These results were helpful for rapidly and accurately estimating the content of anthocyanins/carotenoids.}

  abstract = {A quarter of a century ago, the first systematic behavioral experiments were performed to clarify the nature of color constancy—the effect whereby the perceived color of a surface remains constant despite changes in the spectrum of the illumination. At about the same time, new models of color constancy appeared, along with physiological data on cortical mechanisms and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes. Since then, as this review shows, there have been many advances. The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world.}
