\section{Related Work}

Investigations into the per-se accuracy of color constancy methods are quite common, as an analysis will usually be a part of each new proposed method.
In addition, more direct surveys without a proposed new method have also been performed \cite{barnard2002comparison1} \cite{barnard2002comparison2}.

Agarwal et al. \cite{Agarwal2006} performed an investigation into not just the performance of different color constancy methods, but also their usefulness
in the context of video tracking tasks.
