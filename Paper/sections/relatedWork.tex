\section{Related Work}

As we do not propose any kind of new algorithm, we will make use of existing solutions for both
the computation of the colour corrected image, and the actual classification of the images.
On the side of colour constancy, we have found the follwing approaches, which include code/pretrained models:
\cite{hu2017fc}, \cite{afifi2018}, \cite{afifi2021} and \cite{Lo_2021_CVPR}.

There are two datasets of labeled images of flowers we can use to test: \cite{Nilsback06} and \cite{Nilsback08}
