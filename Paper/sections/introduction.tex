\section{Introduction}

\gls{CC} is a natural part of the human visual system that lets us recognize that a color
stays the same even under changing illumination. Letting computers do this same thing and then
modify the image color to represent their appearance under a neutral light source is a well-established
and on-going area of research. One of the presumed benefits of doing this is improved performance
of recognition tasks that rely to a large part on color, as it removes the need for the classification
model to learn to recognize objects under changing lighting conditions.

While some effort has been made to investigate how \gls{CC} correction can aid in video tracking
\cite{Agarwal2006}, as far as we can tell, no investigation specific to the field of object
classification has, as of yet, been performed. In this paper, we will do just that, using the
classification of flowers as a sample task, since this is clearly an area where color is of large
importance to a successful classification.

% Todo:
%! 1- lots of use of 'this'. Can the sentence be rewritten to be clearer?
%! 2- the use of terms such as 'as far as we know' and 'clearly' is dangerous. Alternatives?
%! 3- 'While some effort has been made...' -> 'While efforts to investigate... have been made, as far as...'
