\section{Future Work}

\subsubsection{Color Constancy Algorithms}

In this work, we only investigated very simple statistical methods as well as one more complex model to serve as a representative
for deep learning based approaches (FC\textsuperscript{4}). While this can serve to deliver baseline results, it might be worth investigating
whether other, more sophisticated method of applying color constancy will deliver better results.

\subsubsection{Datasets}

Similar to the above concerns, in this paper we limited ourselves to only working with images of flowers. It is possible that images from 
other domains will experience wildly different results. Most images of flowers are captured outside, meaning there is already less variation in
light color than pictures taken in other circumstances. We thus believe that a followup with a wider range of categories would be useful.

\subsubsection{Model Architecture}

Finally, in the interest of expediency we limited ourselves to only the use of two models, both of which are rather simple in architecture.
