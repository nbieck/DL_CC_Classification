\begin{abstract}
Colour Constancy, attempting to determine the colour of the light in a particular image, and then 
modifying the colour to match what it would have been under some reference illuminant, is a widely studied topic.
One of the main claims that is made as to whether this is a useful endeavor is that it could aid in the training
of other image processing, as the light colour is removed as a point of variation that needs to be learned.

We seek to validate this point by comparing the performance and training times of image classification models on 
a corpus of images of flowers (chosen because of the importance of colour in their identification), with or without
having applied Colour Constancy methods as preprocessing.
